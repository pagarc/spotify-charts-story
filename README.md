Using data scraped from Spotify Charts, we analyzed the top 200 streamed tracks per day, globally, from 2017 to 2019. To get the data, we used the Beautiful Soup and spotipy Python libraries. We then visualized the data with Tableau, turning it into a dashboard as well as a Tableau Story. This repository contains the scripts used to scrape the data and get each track's audio features along with our Tableau workbook.
